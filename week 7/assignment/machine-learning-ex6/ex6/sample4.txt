Dear sir
Hope you're doing well. My name is Muhammad Faizan and I recently graduated, I want to target Erasmus 
scholarship for Europe, which is fully funded master program. In order to meet their requirement and fo
r selection I need two recommendation letters from professors. You taught us Fuzzy logic, in fuzzy I got
A- grade and my fuzzy project was "stock exchange closing price prediction using adaptive neuro fuzzy ", 
which I completed successfully. I have 3.35 CGPA, and I have graduated this year. Kindly give me a Recommenda
tion letter , so I could apply for Erasmus and any other international scholarship. I will be very   thankful
to you.

# Machine-Learning
Machine learning with MATLAB/Octave, coding machine learning algorithms from scratch. This is [Machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) for beginners who wants to learn machine learning. This course is taught by [Prof. Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) on [Coursera](coursera.org). Please use material in this repo when you are stuck in programming assignments, this repo has been created to help machine learning students when they stuck in programming assignments. In this repo, machine leanring algorithms were implmented from scratch in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

In this course linear regression, logistic regression, Neural networks, support vector machines, and K-means clustering have been implemented. And there are some mini projects and assignments also coverd. For instance, spam/non spam email classification, housing price prediction, and other classification projects have been done. Furthemore, guide to diagnose machine learning problem, such overfitting and underfitting have been covered and demonstrated with examples. Anyone who is new to machine leaning, and they need lecture slides for learning and recalling concepts from machine learning course, and if they are looking for lecture slides, the lecture slides have also been included in the repository for machine learning enthusiasts.

This is very comprehensive machine learning course. Which covers Machine leanring from zero to advance level, which covers supervised and unsupervised learning. A great course to start machine leanring journey. Thanks to coursera and Prof.Andrew Ng for this amazing course.

# Coursera Machine Learning course (offered by Stanford University)
Assignments, lecture slides, and files have been included in this repository.





## Course Info
Machine Learning is a kind of Artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more efficient at perdicting
outcomes without being explicitly programmad. In this course,
you will learn and implement machine learning algorithms from scrath.

[This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
(bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine 
learning and AI). The course will also draw from
numerous case studies and applications,
so that you'll also learn how to apply
learning algorithms to building smart
robots (perception, control),
text understanding (web search,
anti-spam), computer vision,
 medical informatics, audio, database mining,
 and other areas.

 




## Credits
This repository my work for this course. This has
been created to help learners when they are stuck in
programming assignments. The code base, quiz questions, and 
diagrams are taken from the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?).
